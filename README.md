# CARPHA-PROJECT  
## Introduction  
The Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) is a regional Institution of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), was established on July 4, 2011, through the ratification of an Inter-Governmental Agreement by CARICOM Heads of Government. CARPHA subsumed the functions of the previous five Regional Health Institutions â€“ The Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC), the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute (CFHI), the Caribbean Health Research Council (CHRC), the Caribbean Regional Drug Testing Laboratory (CRDTL) and the Caribbean Environmental Health Institute (CEHI). The Agency began operation in January 2013 with Headquarters in Port of Spain, Trinidad and offices in Saint Lucia and Jamaica. CARPHA serves 26 Member States in the Caribbean Region.  

The objective of implementing a regional integrated public health surveillance system (RIPHSS) is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regional public health surveillance by utilising modern technologies for data warehousing, real-time data monitoring and alerts, and integrated data reporting functions. The system is expected to collect, analyse, and visualise health-related data from various sources in real-time, to identify trends, patterns, and outbreaks and facilitate timely decision-making. Finally, reporting and data visualisation tools will be used to present the information in accessible and actionable formats to key stakeholders. The integrated system will enable public health officials to monitor and respond to health threats more efficiently and effectively, ultimately improving public health outcomes.

  
## Project Objectives
The major objective of this repository is to serve as the centre domain for all OpenHIM Mediators for the afroementioned implementation of the RIPHSS interoperability microservices.
